# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about direct phone call marketing of a Portuguese banking institution. 

In this project we aim to predict whether the customer decided to subrcribe to the bank's product or not.

The experiment was used both hyperdrive run and automl run. As a result, the best performing model was Voting Ensemble by automl with an accuracy of 0.9173

## Scikit-learn Pipeline



**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
The cluster clean up code was included in the notebook and excecuted at the end of the code.
